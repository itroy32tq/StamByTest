The first full experience of working with the Photon module and organizing multiplayer. Additionally, experience was gained: 
- integration and use of Spine Unity Runtime (using the included free assets)
- creation of virtual joysticks
- building projects for Android

The execution time was limited + I collected all the possible bugs of the modules described above)). Therefore, the physics itself turned out to be weak, in the future I plan to work on improving it.
Unfortunately, the company did not provide feedback, which in my opinion is bad practice
